## AI-ART APPLICATION

The idea for this application was to create an online store where you can buy and sell unique images that will be generated with text using AI intelligence. To enable this, we used Stability.ai's API, Stability Image Ultra. Our application distinguishes two types of users, guests and registered users. Both are allowed to view products and make purchases.
Registered users can also generate their own images and put them up for sale, which in some way will make them artist. After the image has been successfully generated, the user should select a category for it that describes it and specify a price at which the image would be sold. If an image is purchased, the user will earn 95% of the price of the image.
